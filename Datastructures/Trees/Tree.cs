    //Trees are a special kind of graph: they're connected, undirected, acyclic and unweighted. In general trees konsist of
    //Individual vertices (thereafter "TreeItems") that may have an arbitrary amount of children
    //The traversal of trees is similar to that of doubly linked lists with the difference that each item may have an arbitrary
    //amount of successors instead of a maximum of one.

    //Note: one could also declare a class called Tree<T>, but it would only contain a reference to the root and maybe
    //      some operations that aren't considered standard for trees, so instead one would store a reference to the root
    //      TreeItem of the tree in the code using the tree

    //A TreeItem is a single vertex in the tree. It contains a value and stores references to an arbitrary amount of child
    //TreeItems. To ensure that there cannot be a cycle in the tree, the AddChild method takes an instance of type T instead
    //of a TreeItem instance

        //a single item. As every child is an independent object, it's unlikely that two different children come into
        //conflict (a set is characterized by only containing unique objects). Add and Remove operations on HashSets have
        //a time complexity of O(n), though most operations will take constant time, if the hashing algorithm used is
