    //items are added to queue and have to wait in line to be served. Items that are enqueued the earliest will
    //be removed the earliest. "headIndex" points to the element in the array that should be removed from the queue
    //on the next dequeue-call and "tailIndex" points to the index of the cell that should be filled by the next
    //enqueue-call. If "headIndex" and "tailIndex" are the same, the queue is considered empty.
    //The most primitive implementation uses an array that's not resized over the queue's lifetime. If the queue
    //runs full and another object is enqueued, an exception is thrown. Additionally, as the oldest items are
    //dequeued first, one must keep track of the current head and tail of the queue, as it will no longer be
    //guaranteed that the item at index 0 is the next item to be dequeued
