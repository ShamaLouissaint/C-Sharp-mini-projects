    //An array list ist a list that uses an array for data storage with one twist: array lists are usually implemented to have
    //variable length in contrast to arrays which have a fixed length. To achieve that goal, array lists keep track of the number
    //of items stored and allocate a new array with a bigger or smaller size, as soon as a item count threshold is met. Most
    //commonly array lists double in size if the array is half filled. Most basic implementations don't shrink the array if most
    //items are removed from it, but this implementation showcases how shrinking the underlying array could work, allocating a new
    //smaller array with half the size of the original one if a item count threshold of 1/8th the length of the array is met.
    //To ensure that the array always stays viable, the minimum array size is set to 8
    //In contrast to linked lists, the time complexity of deleting an item is O(n) instead of O(1) with n being the number of items
    //that is currently stored, but array lists often are preferred over linked lists, as they are generally easier to work with,
    //because you don't have to keep track of LinkedListItems and therefore you cannot break the list by accident that easily
