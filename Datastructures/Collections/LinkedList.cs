    //A doubly linked list ist a data structure that is composed of single items that have a value and a reference to
    //the previous item and the next item in the list. The list itself only stores a reference to the the current head
    //(i.e. the first item) of the list.
    //If an item has to be inserted, a new item is created, linked and set as the new head. If one would want to insert
    //items at the end of the list, one would have to keep a reference to the tail of the list and add the new item after
    //that.
    //In practice array-based lists are preferred over linked lists in most cases, as following so many references is less
    //efficient than reading values from an array.
    //Linked lists don't need a delete operation, as the links only consist of references between items, if one would want
    //to remove an item from the list, one must only reassign the the next reference of the item's previous item and the
    //previous reference of the item's next item in O(1) time
